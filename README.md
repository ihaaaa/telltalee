# 🧠 Tell Tale – A Pixel Oracle for Mental Health

**Byte Me's Submission for Pixel Palette Hackathon**

Tell Tale is a pixel-art–inspired web experience that blends emotional expression with AI-powered feedback. Users enter a mystical cave, meet a mysterious oracle, and are invited to reflect on how they feel. Behind the scenes, powerful LLMs (like Gemini) analyze the user's text and return insights, comfort, or helpful resources — all through a gentle, interactive interface.
